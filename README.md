# 👁️ VisionBridge Mobile  
### Gesture-Enabled Learning Platform for Sri Lankan Visually Impaired Students in ICT O/L Education  
**Project ID:** 25-26J-230  

---

## 📘 Overview
**VisionBridge Mobile** is a cross-platform mobile learning solution designed to empower **visually impaired Ordinary Level ICT students** in Sri Lanka.  
It introduces a **multi-sensory interaction model** combining **custom gestures**, **vibration feedback**, and **audio-based content delivery** to promote independent learning and accessibility.

The platform’s design goes beyond traditional screen readers by enabling geometric gesture controls, haptic cues, and non-verbal sound effects that enhance usability, reduce error rates, and improve engagement.

It includes:
- A **mobile app** for visually impaired students.  
- A **teacher dashboard** for lesson uploads and progress tracking.  
- An **accessible content builder** for converting ICT syllabus material.  
- An **audio quiz engine** for interactive self-learning.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### 🧩 Main Objective
To develop an accessible gesture-enabled mobile learning platform for visually impaired ICT learners, combining **gesture recognition**, **vibration feedback**, and **audio narration** to promote independent, inclusive education.

### 🧩 Specific Objectives
- Implement **gesture-based navigation** with geometric commands.  
- Provide **multi-modal feedback** (haptic + audio + sound effects).  
- Enable **audio-first learning** through lessons and quizzes.  
- Allow teachers to upload and analyze content and performance data.  
- Facilitate **offline access** with local database storage.

## 👨‍💻 Individual Components and Responsibilities

### 🟦 **H.E.M Thathsara (IT22322562) — Custom Gestures, Haptics & Sound Effects**
**Responsibilities:**
- Implement basic gestures: swipe, tap, long-press, pan.  
- Add custom geometric gestures (circle, triangle, rectangle).  
- Integrate haptic feedback:  
  - Short buzz = next  
  - Long buzz = error  
  - Double buzz = selection  
- Add sound cues (chime = correct, low tone = wrong, click = navigation).  

**Novelty:**
- Introduces a new **gesture vocabulary** beyond standard swipe/tap.  
- Combines vibration + audio + effects for **multi-sensory learning**.  
- Tailors the interaction model to ICT education, not generic accessibility.
